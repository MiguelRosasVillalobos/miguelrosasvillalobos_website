  ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the current status and future research and
              development perspectives associated with technologies to harness
              offshore renewable energy, including offshore wind, waves, tides,
              ocean currents, and thermal and salinity gradient, in South America
              (SA). It focuses on five countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile,
              Colombia and Uruguay. At first, a comprehensive survey presents the
              number of scientific papers classified based on the resource to
              show the tendency and importance of such subjects in the academic
              community. Each country’s electricity matrix and grid connection
              are shown to understand the region’s renewable source participation
              situation. The potential of offshore renewable resources is
              addressed by considering the published technical papers in
              scientific journals. The main conflicts and synergies associated
              with ocean space utilization are presented by considering the
              exclusive economic zone of each country. The status of the
              regulatory frameworks to promote and development of offshore
              renewable energies is presented. Two sections are dedicated to
              presenting the active, decommissioned and planned projects,
              research groups and laboratory infrastructures to develop the
              technologies. The last section discusses the future perspectives on
              the development of this sector in SA. It is observed that SA, with
              more than 25,000 km of coastline, has a great potential for
              offshore renewable energy; however, so far, these resources have
              not been explored commercially. Larger investment in the sector,
              establishing an adequate legal framework and deploying full-scale
              demonstration projects at sea are necessary for the
              commercialization of such technologies in SA.},
