I am a passionate mechanical engineer with a strong interest in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and numerical simulations. My expertise lies in utilizing OpenFOAM, an open-source CFD software package, to solve complex fluid flow problems. I have experience in simulating a wide range of fluid flow phenomena, from laminar to turbulent flows, and I am constantly exploring new techniques to improve simulation accuracy and efficiency.
